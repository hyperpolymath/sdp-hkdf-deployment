# 2. PROVENANCE: Every deployment artifact must carry a valid SPDX header.
# 3. REVERSIBILITY: All deployment actions must have a corresponding rollback recipe.

# REPOSITORY STRUCTURE:
# - configs/: Declarative Nickel environments.
# - containerfiles/: Hardened OCI image definitions.
# - contractiles/: Formal deployment contracts (K9).
